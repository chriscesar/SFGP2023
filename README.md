# SFGP2023
Code for conducting analyses of data as part of the **Saltfleet to Gibraltar Point** Environmental Monitoring for 2023

Annual reporting is conducted to assess the impacts of annual beach nourishment activity on intertidal and 
subtidal biological and abiotic receptor variables.

## Analyses conducted
The scripts within this repo perform the following tasks:
* Import of new data from annual monitoring work
* Formatting new data and merging with existant data sets
* Statistical analysis of data to infer impacts
* Produce graphical and statistical outputs to visualise analysis outputs

## Variables considered
The analyses conducted cover a range of variables, encompassing intertidal and subtidal receptors

### Intertidal
Intertidal core surveys, aimed at gathering the following:
* Infaunal diversity and multivariate analyses
* Particle size analyses and sediment destributional statistics
* Abiotic parameters (chemical)
* Beach descriptors
* *Cerastoderma* stock trends

### Subtidal
Benthic beam trawl surveys gathering the following:
* Epifaunal taxon counts and diversity analyses
* Shrimp (*Crangon* spp.) demographics
